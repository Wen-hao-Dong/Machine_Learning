## Chaper 6 Supervised Learning--Linear Regression

Besides simple linear regression, in which we discuss relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable, other linear relationships include:
- **Multiple Regression** Linear relationships between two or more indenpendent variables and one dependent variable
- **Polynomial Regression** Relationships between one independent variable and one dependent variable using an nth degree polynomial function
- **Polynomial Multiple Regression** Relationships between two or more indenpendent variables and one dependent variable using an nth degree polynomial function
